# Anagram Checker

Anagram Checker is a Java application that allows you to determine if two given texts are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. This application provides an efficient way to check whether two texts share the same set of characters and character frequencies.
